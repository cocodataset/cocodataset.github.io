    "description": "We train stuff segmentation model and instance segmentation model separately and merge the results. For the stuff segmentation, we enhance PSPNet [1] with a backbone network by larger dilation rate and more residual blocks to enlarge the effective receptive field. In addition, we jointly train COCO stuff and instance to get more context information. Our single model achieved 54.1 mIOU on the validation set. An ensemble of three models boosted the accuracy to 55.9. We use 8 V100 (16G memory) GPU cards. For the instance segmentation, we adopt a two-pass pipeline. Please see more details in our instance segmentation submission. Our final panoptic segmentation result is 53.2 PQ on test-dev, by merging the stuff result (55.9 mIOU in the validation set) and instance result (48.8 mmAP on test-dev). We use ShuffleNet V2 as the backbone network of above two tasks. [1] Pyramid Scene Parsing Network. Hengshuang Zhao, Jianping Shi, Xiaojuan Qi, Xiaogang Wang, Jiaya Jia. CVPR 2017.

    "description": "We get panoptic segmentation result by combining stuff result from semantic segmentation and thing result from instance segmentation with the strategy described in Panoptic Segmentation[1]. For segmentation of thing, we develop a region-based object detection and instance segmentation approach, which follows Mask-RCNN[2]. Feature pyramid network[3] is used as our backbone for multi-scale feature extraction. And we use Cascade-RCNN[4] as our box head, which iteratively regress and refine the box location. For mask head, we propose a new module called Cascade-MASK, which exploits the ROIs of different stage from box head to iteratively refine the mask results and improve the mask result by 1.3% on val5000 in our best res50 based model. Finally we use senet154 as backbone to generate the segmentation results of thing. For segmentation of stuff, we follow the FCN way which regard semantic segmentation as pixel-wise classification. We combine all thing classes as one class for training. Feature pyramid network[3] modified with deformable convolution[5] and non-local convolution[6] is used as our backbone. For all submissions, we only use the ImageNet pretrained model and train with coco2017 panoptic segmentation annotations and instance segmentation annotations. submission 1 combined stuff result using resnext152 64g as backbone and thing result using senet as backbone train with instance segmentaion annotation. submission 2 combined stuff result using ensamble model(resnext152 64g and senet 154 and resnext152 32g and resnet 152) as backbone and thing result using senet as backbone train with instance segmentaion annotation. submission 3 combined stuff result using ensamble model(resnext152 64g and senet 154 and resnext 152 32g and resnet 152) as backbone and thing result using senet as backbone train with instance segmentaion annotation. submission 4 combined stuff result using ensamble model(resnext152 64g and senet 154 and resnext 152 32g) as backbone and thing result using senet as backbone train with instance segmentaion annotation. submission 5 combined stuff result using ensamble model(resnext152 64g and senet 154 and resnext 152 32g and resnet 152) as backbone and thing result using senet as backbone train with panoptic segmentaion annotation.

    "description": "Based on the powerful FPN-Mask-RCNN [1,2] and Deeplabv3+ [3] model, we explore the possibility of combining the two models into a single e2e trainable model. When comparing the two models side by side, we can observe that both models share a similar \u201cencoder-decoder\u201d architecture that can be combined. In FPN-Mask-RCNN, the FPN backbone [1], which has an \u201cencoder-decoder\u201d architecture, can be used to create the Deeplabv3+ model. This is done by adding a FCN-style semantic prediction head onto the final feature-map of the pyramid structure. We reason that since each pyramid level contains information from the previous layer and also from the encoder branch through the skip connections, the final feature-map should contain the relevant information needed for pixel-wise semantic segmentation. In addition to the semantic head, we also incorporate the ASPP-layer from Deeplabv3+ into the FPN backbone. The model is then trained e2e (stably) using a combination of 6 losses: 5 losses from the standard Mask-RCNN and 1 from the semantic head. For the final panoptic segmentation, we employ only an adaptive thresholding method (AT-Fusion) to fuse the output predictions from the Mask-RCNN head and also the semantic prediction head. The fusion is done by first fusing the instances together using adaptive thresholding and prediction scores, while the semantic prediction is used to fill in the background. The adaptive thresholding is done by coupling the final thresholding of the instance detection with the prediction probability of the semantic head. There are 2 reasons for this adaptive thresholding. Firstly, compared to just using a certain region in the Mask-RCNN head, the semantic head uses the information from the entire image/scene for prediction, making the prediction much more reliable. Secondly, as \u201cargmax\u201d is used to produce the final semantic labels, a certain label doesn\u2019t need to have a 0.99 prediction probability to be chosen as the final output. This means that if semantic prediction can be performed without hard constraint, then the same idea can also be applied to the instance detection. As of the time of submission, the first results are submitted for the challenge while experiments and works are still being done to validate the performance of the proposed method.
