[{"description": "We train stuff segmentation model and instance segmentation model separately and merge the results. For the stuff segmentation, we enhance PSPNet [1] with a backbone network by larger dilation rate and more residual blocks to enlarge the effective receptive field. In addition, we jointly train COCO stuff and instance to get more context information. Our single model achieved 54.1 mIOU on the validation set. An ensemble of three models boosted the accuracy to 55.9. We use 8 V100 (16G memory) GPU cards. For the instance segmentation, we adopt a two-pass pipeline. Please see more details in our instance segmentation submission. Our final panoptic segmentation result is 53.2 PQ on test-dev, by merging the stuff result (55.9 mIOU in the validation set) and instance result (48.8 mmAP on test-dev). We use ShuffleNet V2 as the backbone network of above two tasks. [1] Pyramid Scene Parsing Network. Hengshuang Zhao, Jianping Shi, Xiaojuan Qi, Xiaogang Wang, Jiaya Jia. CVPR 2017.

When comparing the two models side by side, we can observe that both models share a similar \u201cencoder-decoder\u201d architecture that can be combined. In FPN-Mask-RCNN, the FPN backbone [1], which has an \u201cencoder-decoder\u201d architecture, can be used to create the Deeplabv3+ model. This is done by adding a FCN-style semantic prediction head onto the final feature-map of the pyramid structure. We reason that since each pyramid level contains information from the previous layer and also from the encoder branch through the skip connections, the final feature-map should contain the relevant information needed for pixel-wise semantic segmentation. In addition to the semantic head, we also incorporate the ASPP-layer from Deeplabv3+ into the FPN backbone. The model is then trained e2e (stably) using a combination of 6 losses: 5 losses from the standard Mask-RCNN and 1 from the semantic head. For the final panoptic segmentation, we employ only an adaptive thresholding method (AT-Fusion) to fuse the output predictions from the Mask-RCNN head and also the semantic prediction head. The fusion is done by first fusing the instances together using adaptive thresholding and prediction scores, while the semantic prediction is used to fill in the background. The adaptive thresholding is done by coupling the final thresholding of the instance detection with the prediction probability of the semantic head. There are 2 reasons for this adaptive thresholding. Firstly, compared to just using a certain region in the Mask-RCNN head, the semantic head uses the information from the entire image/scene for prediction, making the prediction much more reliable. Secondly, as \u201cargmax\u201d is used to produce the final semantic labels, a certain label doesn\u2019t need to have a 0.99 prediction probability to be chosen as the final output. This means that if semantic prediction can be performed without hard constraint, then the same idea can also be applied to the instance detection. As of the time of submission, the first results are submitted for the challenge while experiments and works are still being done to validate the performance of the proposed method.
